Half API library
-----------------

This is a C++ header-only library to provide an IEEE 754 conformant 16-bit half-precision floating-point type along with corresponding arithmetic operators, type conversions and common mathematical functions. 
It aims for both efficiency and ease of use, trying to accurately mimic the behaviour of the built-in floating-point types at the best performance possible. 

Users may refer to `Half APIs <https://half.sourceforge.net/index.html>`_ for more information.
